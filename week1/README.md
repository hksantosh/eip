## CNN Result/Score: 

## Definitions
1. Convolution: An operation that transforms input data into a specific feature(s) rich output using a filter/kernel.
2. Filter/Kernel: An operator that allows only the desired qualities of the input to pass through it.
3. Epochs: One full pass/iteration of all training samples through a neural network.
4. 1x1 Convolution: Operation that extracts a specific feature from the input data and generates output of same dimension as input.
5. 3x3 Convolution: Operation that extracts specific feature(s) from input data by using a 3x3 filter and generates output of lesser dimension (by 2x2).
6. Feature Maps: A map of desired qualities/features. Typically an input/output to/of convolution.
7. Activation Function: A function designed to activate a neuron if it's input is useful for achieving the model's objective.
8. Receptive Field: During convolution, at a time, filter is applied only to a part of input data. This part is called as receptive field.
